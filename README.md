# NYC Taxi Data Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze New York City taxi data using a robust tech stack that includes Docker for containerization, Postgres as the database, PgAdmin for database management, and Terraform for infrastructure provisioning on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The goal is to derive meaningful insights from the NYC taxi dataset to understand patterns, behaviors, and potentially, areas for improvement in urban mobility.

## Course Modules

- **Introduction to GCP:** An overview of Google Cloud Platform, focusing on its core services and how it can be leveraged for scalable data analysis projects.
- **Docker and Docker-compose:** Understanding containerization with Docker, and using Docker-compose to manage multi-container applications.
- **Running Postgres Locally with Docker:** Step-by-step guide to setting up a Postgres database locally using Docker, which serves as the backbone for our data analysis.
- **Setting up Infrastructure on GCP with Terraform:** Instructions on using Terraform for provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure on GCP, making our project scalable and reproducible.
